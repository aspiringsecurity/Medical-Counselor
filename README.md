# zk Medical DAO

Medical Counselor for Preventive Treatment & Remediation. Health and nutrition counseling and prevention from hospital acquired infections, preventive treatment and remediation over the AStar Network using Ink Smart Contracts and Acurast low code/no code DAO tool.

Just in Time Service: Availability of pharma companies medicine records across different stakeholder through secure Web3 eco-system tools.

• Record Management: Quality documentation reduces the issues regarding testing procedures and standardization.

• Research: Enabling the healthcare community by empowering pharma companies & the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing securely, transparently.

• Data Security: Efficiently sharing of data (including personal data), privacy concerns and patient enrollment strategies.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital drug discovery infrastructure, created by electronic medicine trial and test records as a service (EMTTRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way medicines are developed, tested and distributed to improve the global health economy and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals in Healthcare.


## The problem it solves

1. Developer Tools to enable medical trial testing, clinical trials via EMTTRs (Electronic Medicine Trial and Test Records as a Service) and EHR and Radiology services.

2.  Secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity using Web3 ecosystem tools.

3. Improving Data Transparency in Drug Testing. Enabling the bottom of pyramid through empowering pharma companies and the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing and clinical trials via blockchain.

4.  Enabling healthcare community by empowering pharma companies & the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing securely, transparently.


## Implementation

How we built it
Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal powered by Ink Smart Contracts, Azero.ID, AlphaZero Defi and dev tooling, Polkadot blockchain and Web3 tools. Enable secure data storage; transparency of medical report data.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAOs using AZero.ID:

DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp.

Doctor can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created using Ink.

Doctors that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.

Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on Polkadot with the most recent vote linking to one before using AZero.ID.

Further, we are developing DAO tooling for hospitals. Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Medical-Counselor/tree/main/hospital-DAO-astar#dao-tools-for-hospitals-using-ink-smart-contracts

AlphZero based Wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser with features like Account creation;
